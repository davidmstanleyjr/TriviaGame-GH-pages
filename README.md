I hope you enjoy my Game of Thrones Trivia Game. I made this game to demonstrate my skill with Jquery, Javascript and with timers. We were allowed to pick our own theme for this assignment and I chose Game of Thrones because i'm a huge fan.

My main issue was getting the music to work. What I did was download the song from youtube using an mp3 converter and then I used an audio tag in HTML to make it work.
